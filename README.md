ASReview material for a scoping review.

The .Rmd file will automatically produce a summary report (.html) on the level of agreement between two raters. Note that this is work in progress -- please do compare to your own findings, make suggestions and let me know if there are any issues!

Step 1: Download and save the .csv outputs from ASReview into the 'data' folder.  
Step 2: Open up the asreview_irr.Rproj in RStdudio.  
Step 3: Open report_example.Rmd and change the .csv file names accordingly, so it loads in your data.  
Step 4: Knit the report.
