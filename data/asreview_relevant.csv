Not much is known, however, about the nature of these contacts and how the patterns of everyday life can lead to the initial contact with, and type of police response to, EDP. To address this issue, a spatial point pattern test is used to compare the spatial distributions of callsfor- service involving EDP (n = 2,847) to all other police contacts (n = 137,901) in an urban Canadian setting. Findings indicate that there are significant variations among these two calls-for-service, with EDP calls clustering on very few street segments. To better understand this clustering, a series of place attractors that may affect EDP are analyzed. It is suggested that a link may exist between the density of place attractors and that of EDP calls-for-service.

Using a sample of 4341 police incidents over a three-year period, 13 pairwise spatial comparisons of similarity were completed across four dimensions: Mental Health Act events, criminal and non-criminal events, and gender. Results indicate that the locations in which EDP intersect with police services are spatially concentrated, and the spatial patterns differ depending on whether the events are calls that fall under the Mental Health Act, criminal, or non-criminal in nature. When considering the gender component, findings indicate that the locations of Mental Health Act calls are the most spatially distinct between males and females. Findings further emphasise that EDP are involved in many different types of contacts with the police, most of which are apprehensions under the British Columbia Mental Health Act, followed by criminal and non-criminal interactions. From a spatial perspective, the findings also highlight the need to differentiate between genders as well as event types to improve police resourcing and better guide situational crime prevention efforts.

There are a number of areas where concepts and techniques for repeat victim research could potentially be strengthened: (a) clarifying the connections between hot dots and hot spots, particularly through exploration of the concept of a 'near repeat address'; (b) applying survival analysis to the data on the time periods between victimisations; and (c) using moving average techniques to examine changes in the spatial distributions of burglary over time.

These incidents comprise about 8% of the police department's workload that originates from the public. Calls appear to be highly concentrated in a few areas, and specifically the Center City and Kensington neighborhoods. They are also more likely to occur late afternoon and evening. The article shows that some medical or public health activity initially masquerades as crime or other policing work and some events eventually determined to be police/crime activity can initially appear to be public health related.

Temporal patterns for two-hour time periods, spatial patterns at the small-area scale, and space-time interaction (i.e., unusual departures from overall spatial and temporal patterns) were estimated. Temporally, calls-for-service were found to be lowest in the early morning (02:00-03:59) and highest in the evening (20:00-21:59), while high levels of calls-for-service were spatially located in central business areas and in areas characterized by major roadways, universities, and shopping centres. Space-time interaction was observed to be geographically dispersed during daytime hours but concentrated in central business areas during evening hours. Interpreted through the routine activity theory, results are discussed with respect to law enforcement resource demand and allocation, and the advantages of modeling spatio-temporal datasets with Bayesian INLA methods are highlighted.

We believe that at least three separate sets of factors have contributed to these high rates: (1) social disorganization and related community structural factors, (2) over-densities in the distribution of alcohol outlets, and (3) illegal drug markets. Data were collected for the city of Sacramento, CA, for the years 1997 through 2001 and geocoded to 304 Census block groups. The outcome measure for the study was numbers of Emergency Medical System (EMS, ambulance, and fire) calls for service related to assault injuries. Data on population and housing characteristics related to social disorganization were obtained from the US Census. California Alcohol Beverage Control data provided the locations of active alcohol outlets in the city separated into bars and taverns and off-premise establishments. Sacramento Police Department incident reports related to drug sales and transport were used to indicate areas of the city where drug market activities were most prevalent. Bayesian disease models were used to assess statistical relationships between EMS assault injuries and these independent measures. The index of drug market activity and numbers of alcohol outlets were positively related to the number of assault injuries. Areas with lesser White and greater African-American populations had more assaults. Lower education, greater amounts of vacant housing, and more unemployment were also related to greater levels of violence. However, contrary to the expectations, more owner-occupied housing and greater household incomes were positively related to the levels of assaults, and greater numbers of households below the poverty line were related to lower levels of assaults. A substantive effect was observed for the interaction of drug arrests and poverty, indicating lower levels of violence in poor areas with high degrees of drug activity (actually increasing the size of the anomalous effect noted in the previous paragraph). Substantive positive interactions were observed with respect to sizes of minority populations, African-Americans, and Hispanics. Drug market activities and alcohol outlets have separable and substantive effects upon observed rates of violence. These environmental conditions serve as catalysts for violence among at-risk populations.

Data were obtained from Statistics Canada's 1996 Census and the Vancouver Police Department's calls for service database. Overall, the results support the utility of synthesizing social disorganization and routine activity theories. In particular, high unemployment (social disorganization theory) and the presence of young populations (routine activity theory) are the strongest predictors of criminal activity. Without such a synthesis, employing one of the theories in isolation would likely have reduced the predictive power in the spatial error statistical model.","Andresen, M A",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,7

Throughout the world large-scale political, social, economic, cultural, and sporting events have become commonplace. Natural disasters such as blackouts, hurricanes, tornadoes, and tsunamis present similar opportunities. Such events often tax the capacities of jurisdictions to provide safety and security in response to the exceptional event, as well as to meet the ""routine"" public safety needs. This article examines ""routine"" crime as measured by calls for police service, official crime reports, and police arrests in Salt Lake City before, during, and after the 2002 Olympic Games. The analyses suggest that while a rather benign demographic among attendees and the presence of large numbers of social control agents might have been expected to decrease calls for police service for minor crime, it actually increased in Salt Lake during this period. The implications of these findings are considered for theories of routine activities, as well as systems capacity. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

First, the peak time of criminal activity in a particular neighborhood varies according to seasonal variables as well as the type of neighborhood (i.e. commercial/industrial, residential, etc.). Second, criminal activity is more likely to occur in some neighborhoods than in others. Most research on these two facts has been conducted in large metropolitan areas. Metropolitan areas are different structurally than smaller non-urban areas. Are these findings similar when we consider a suburban community? This study explores the occurrence of crime during peak times and at hot locations related to the non urban school schedule and calendar. These analyses were guided by routine activities theory and sought to prove that the temporal and spatial variation of crime in a non-urban city is explained by the school routine of juveniles. I used local police department Calls For Service data to plot both location and reported time of each act of vandalism over a three year period. The temporal data proved to be a poor measure of the temporal variation because it recorded a time when the crime was discovered and reported rather than when it occurred. I found that when school is in the distance from the school that crime occurs is greater on the weekend when juveniles are out of school than during the week when they are at school.

The extent to which these calls are concentrated on a small number of street segments, similar to traditional crime calls for service is understudied. The purpose of this paper is to examine the concentration of mental health calls and the spatial distribution of street segments with mental health calls to provide directions for law enforcement and place-based policing. Design/methodology/approach Using call for service data from a large city on the East coast, the current study examines whether mental health calls for service are concentrated on street segments, and tests spatial dispersion to whether these mental health hot spots are spread throughout the city or clustered in space. Finally, the authors explore the relationship between mental health calls and violent and drug calls by calculating the correlation and using a spatial point pattern test to determine if mental health calls are spatially similar to violent and drug calls. Findings The authors found that mental health calls are concentrated on street segments; specifically 22.4 percent of calls are located on 0.5 percent of city street segments. Additionally, these street segments are fairly dispersed throughout the city. When comparing the spatial similarity of mental health calls to violent and drug calls, they are highly correlated suggesting a relationship between the calls types, but the location of mental health calls appears to be different from violet and drug calls. Originality/value Very few studies have examined the location of mental health calls and whether they are concentrated in small areas similar to crime, but such research can provide police officers new approaches to working with people with mental health problems. The police are the primary emergency response for calls involving someone with a mental illness or experiencing a mental health crisis and the authors provide suggestions for policing that draw from strategies used in hot spot policing and mental health responses, like CIT, to address challenges of modern policing and working with people with mental health problems.

Targeted, place-focused interventions have been demonstrated to prevent future problems for emergency services. This research builds on these findings to examine the spatial and temporal intersection of police, fire, and ambulance incidents to explore the potential utility of enhanced collaboration between emergency-first responders. Using police and fire data from Surrey, BC, Canada, from 2011 to 2013, spatial and temporal patterns of police-, fire-, and ambulance-related incidents were examined. Initial analyses demonstrate that 36% of the City's area experienced 72% of incidents responded to over this 3-year study period. Focusing on this high-volume area, the spatial and temporal intersection of these incident types was explored. Spatially, lattices of varying cell sizes (250 m, 500 m, and 1,000 m) were placed over the study area. Temporally, incident volume was examined across the entire 3-year study period, and at yearly andmonthly intervals. Incidents were placed within these spatial and temporal frameworks and visual inspection was utilized to assess the convergence of service demand. Regardless of the cell grid size, police, fire, and ambulance incidents were spatially and temporally concentrated, with the top 10% of cells accounting for approximately 50% of all incidents across all services. Furthermore, there was considerable spatio-temporal convergence in cells which account for the top decile of call volume for all incident types. A 2 x 2 typology is proposed to classify locations (in this case grid cells) based on (1) the frequency at which they generate high demand for services (sporadic versus persistent), and (2) the combination of agencies required to respond to high demand problems (single versus convergent). The spatial and temporal convergence of emergency service problems observed in this study suggests that an interagency approach to problem identification will enhance problem analysis processes. Working in conjunction with established problemfocused intervention strategies (such as problem-oriented policing), the volume-service typology provides a framework that can contribute to the development of appropriate problem-responses.

Understanding patterns in criminal activity allows for the prediction of future high-risk crime 'hot spots' and enables police precincts to more effectively allocate officers to prevent or respond to incidents. With the ever-increasing ability of states and organizations to collect and store detailed data tracking crime occurrence, a significant amount of data with spatial and temporal information has been collected. How to use the benefit of massive spatial-temporal information to precisely predict the regional crime rates becomes necessary. The recurrent neural network model has been widely proven effective for detecting the temporal patterns in a time series. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal neural network (STNN) to precisely forecast crime hot spots with embedding spatial information. We evaluate the model using call-for-service data provided by the Portland, Oregon Police Bureau (PPB) for a 5-year period from March 2012 through the end of December 2016. We show that our STNN model outperforms a number of classical machine learning approaches and some alternative neural network architectures.

This current focus on crime science provides administrators with up to date details of crime and crime patterns within municipalities as well as the ability to focus on smaller geographic areas. Particular emphasis has been placed on 'hot spots' analyses wherein police efforts are concentrated in these smaller geographic areas, characterized by disproportionately greater crime counts or an increased count of calls for service. Unfortunately, this emphasis on hot spots analyses leads us to a circular reasoning where crime is the only, or best, predictor of crime. This research offers an alternative through the construction of theoretically driven hot spots.

A potential limitation is that most studies only use one data source to diagnose these patterns. The present study uses data from both police and emergency medical services (EMS) to explore the spatial concentration and stability of drug activity in Seattle, Washington from 2009 to 2014. We use concentration graphs and group-based trajectory analysis to examine concentration and stability of calls related to drug activity in both data sources separately and combined. Additionally, we employ Andresen's S-Index to determine the similarity of concentration within the SPD data, the EMS data and the combined data year to year as well as the degree of co-location between the SPD and EMS data during the study period. We find a high degree of concentration and group-based stability for both SPD and EMS drug calls across all street segments in Seattle. Conversely, we find only moderate local geographic stability of drug use across street segments as indicated by each of the data sources over the study period. Last, we find the spatial patterns in drug use as indicated by each data source are significantly different each year. At the same time these findings provide support for the law of crime concentration, they also raise questions about local stability patterns. Additionally, they highlight the importance of expanding inquiries of crime and place research into new data sources.

We applied hot spot mapping, near repeat diagnosis, and spatial regression approaches to the analysis of gunshot incidents and their associated neighborhood characteristics. We observed significant discrepancies between GDT data and 911 calls for service, which indicate possible underreporting of firearm discharge in 911 call data. The near repeat analysis suggests an increased risk of gunshots in nearby locations following an initial event. Results of spatial regression models validate the hypothesis of spatial dependence in frequencies of gunshot incidents and crime underreporting across neighborhoods in the study area, both of which are positively associated with proportions of African American residents, who are less likely to report a gunshot.

Crime is a product of our normal everyday routines. This research examines how Hurricane Hugo altered routine activities during the period 22nd September-2nd October 1989, in Charlotte, North Carolina. The impacts of this natural disaster are reflected by changes in the quantity, nature, and timing of calls for police service.A modified routine activity framework is employed to explain the conceptual linkages among routine activities, time, calls to the police, and weather. Furthermore, different time periods are defined as being primarily for the pursuit of either obligatory or discretionary routine activities. The calls-for-service data for this research emanate from the computer-aided dispatch files of the Charlotte Police Department.The results indicate that Hurricane Hugo seriously impeded the circulation of the city and disrupted routine activities. Calls for service increased greatly during the day of Hugo's arrival, and remained high for over a week. The inability of the population to pursue their normal routine activity patterns meant that time periods ordinarily used for the pursuit of obligatory activities changed to discretionary time periods. Moreover, while the police still fulfilled their law enforcement function, the nature and volume of the calls indicated a greater emphasis on order maintenance and service functions. Finally, during Hugo's arrival day and the following three days of recovery burglary reports were much higher than normal, as were reports of a man with a gun; the former implies that the hurricane increased vulnerable targets, while the latter implies defensive gun use may have been used as a method of enhancing guardianship.

This study uses Andresen's Spatial Point Pattern Test to compare the spatial similarity between police proactivity and crime, as well as regression modeling to explore the relationship between proactivity and crime and the time spent on proactivity and crime. In the jurisdiction examined, high levels of proactivity are noted. This proactive activity is more likely to occur in places where crime is most concentrated. Additionally, the number of proactive calls and the proactive time spent per crime-and-disorder call remain high and stable across spatial scales. For each crime call received at a street block, police initiated 0.7 proactive activities and spent approximately 28 min carrying out proactive works. This study develops a way of measuring proactive activity by patrol officers using calls for service data. We find that not only do officers in this jurisdiction exhibit higher levels of proactivity to prevent crime (compared to reacting to crime), but they also do so in targeted, micro-place ways. Agencies may consider using similar techniques to gauge the levels of proactivity in their agencies if proactive activity is a goal.

Much of the research dealing with crime on public transit has focused on analyzing crime occurring within the stations.

As well, an examination is conducted regarding the accessibility of Health Care Centers (HCCs) in relation to individuals in need of medical assistance. Distance-based measures of spatial association, including nearest neighbor and K-function analysis, were used to determine the clustering of calls at various spatial scales. Structural neighborhood characteristics (i.e., distance to the closest HCC) and physical and social vulnerability were used to predict the rate of calls for a heroin-related injury per 1,000 persons in the city of Boston using a spatial autoregressive model. HCC catchment areas for the set of medical emergency calls were created using Voronoi tessellations. Results showed that the average nearest neighbor distance (NND) of each call for medical assistance was approximately 187 m or .12 miles. Calls for assistance became more probable and increasingly more spatially concentrated over the study period. The K-function analysis revealed that the calls clustered at different spatial scales and in proximity to HCCs. Average distance to the nearest HCC and Household/Disability vulnerability were significantly associated with the census tract call rate per 1,000 persons. The average travel distance between the calls for medical assistance and the nearest HCC was 941 m, or just over a half-mile. Policy implications for the provision, through HCCs, of a focused and comprehensive community-based support system in a large urban city for individuals with serious drug problems are discussed in context.

We control for a variety of factors related to social disorganization theory that can lead to crime and potentially disorder. In order to disentangle these relationships, we use a cross-lagged auto-regressive structural equation model and a unique dataset comprised of calls for police service and reported incidents for 117 neighborhoods in Reno, NV. We find that higher rates of disorder lead to significant, but modest, increases in violent crime, but only aggravated assaults lead to increases in disorder.

The purpose of this paper is to provide some insights into response patterns during the 2013 ice storm in the city of Vaughan, Ontario, Canada, using temporal and spatial analyses. Design/methodology/approach: The City of Vaughan Fire and Rescue Service data set containing all responses to fire and other emergency incidents from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2016 was used. The 2013 Southern Ontario ice storm occurred from December 20, 2013 to January 1, 2014, and, for this study, December 20â31 is considered the âstudy period.â Temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal analyses of responses during the study period are carried out and are compared with the same period in other years (2009â2012 and 2014â2016). Findings: The findings show that temporal patterns of response attributes changed significantly during the 2013 ice storm. Similarly, the spatial pattern of responses during the 2013 ice storm showed some major differences with other years. The spatiotemporal analyses also demonstrate significant variations in responses in the city during different hours of the day in the ice storm days. Originality/value: This study is the first study to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of responses made by a fire department during the 2013 ice storm in Canada. It provides some insights into the differences between response volumes, temporal and spatial distributions during large emergency events (e.g. ice storm) and normal situations. The results will help in mitigating the number of responses in the future through public education and technological changes. Moreover, the results will provide fire departments with information that could help them prepare for such events by possible reallocation of resources.

873,JOUR,Emergency mental health calls to first responders following a natural disaster: Examining the effects from Hurricane Harvey,2021,"Disaster, emergency medical services, police, psychiatry",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC MEDICINE,7,1,22,29,NA,NA,"Introduction: Hurricane Harvey which made landfall on August 25, 2017 was a devastating storm that dumped unprecedented amount of rainfall on the area including Houston, Texas, United States of America. There are limited data about emergency service mental health utilization following disaster events. The goal for this project was to examine mental health calls to emergency medical services (EMS) and to the Houston Police Department following Hurricane Harvey. An analysis looking at this utilization following a natural disaster represents an understudied area and can potentially provide information about city services and community psychiatric services in the acute period following the event. Materials and Methods: Total number of calls to the police department and mental health calls to the police department described as crisis intervention calls (Crisis Intervention Team) were obtained from August 1, 2016 to October 31, 2016 and January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017. Emergency detention orders (EDO) per date were obtained from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017. Data for mental health calls based on the primary impression of mental health complaint were obtained from the Houston Fire Department for EMS from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017. Results: There was a statistically significant increase in the number of mental health calls to the police following Hurricane Harvey. When comparing the prestorm, active storm, and poststorm period, there was not a statistically significant difference in the number of EDOs or the number of EMS mental health calls. Conclusions: The increase in police mental health calls suggests that there may have been an increase in the acuity of the mental health calls to EMS around in evaluating calls surrounding the period of Hurricane Harvey.

The analysis is performed at the level of ValÃ¨nciaâs boroughs. It has been carried out using a logistic model after dichotomization of the noise incidence variable. The spatial effects consider first-and second-order neighbors. The temporal effects are included in the model by means of one-and two-week temporal lags. Our model confirms the presence of strong spatio-temporal effects. We also find significant associations between noise incidence and specific age groups, socio-economic status, land uses, and recreational activities, among other variables. The results suggest that there is a problem of ""social"" noise in ValÃ¨ncia that is not exclusively a consequence of coexistence between local residents.

This research explores the nature and distribution of police activity through citizen calls for service in three developing nations of the Caribbean region. It is argued that the social and political context of the jurisdiction determines, at the margins, the nature of citizen calls for police service. That is, for non-serious crime and other services, citizens' calls for police services are predicated upon the nature of the relationship between the citizenry and the police. This study analyzes calls for service data from three Caribbean nations: Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica. The nature and distribution of the calls are analyzed in relationship to the constables' perceptions of their legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry. The findings indicate that the nature of citizen calls for service are related to these perceptions of legitimacy. That is, the more the sensed legitimacy of the police, the greater the citizens' tendency to initiate calls for services that do not involve serious criminal incidents. The policy implications of these findings for police work in developing nations are presented and discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]","Bennett, Richard R",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,38

The policies implemented by the police bodies are focalized in reactive actions and few had been made from a prevention perspective. The theoretical background is provided by the routine activities and crime patterns. To measure the relationship a multiple regression model was test. The data include criminal warrants of robbery (PGJDF, 2010) and other socioeconomic variables (INEGI, 2010), both at census tract level. The methodology used is a Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR). The results of the spatial regression model show that commerce and service land use, public transportation stations and the percentage of male population of 18 to 24 years old increase significantly the opportunities to commit a robbery.

Criminal victimization is a deterministic part of our society but who will fall victim and who will become the offender remains uncertain. Crime, therefore, is characterized both by randomness and determinism, a situation that suggests the application of chaos theory for its study. This article argues that crime is a complex event that is the culmination of several processes emanating from the past. A method called R/S technique, based upon chaos theory is used in an attempt to provide a different insight into the phenomenon of temporal crime data. This analysis uses an illustrative example to demonstrate that police calls for service data have a memory effect that can be identified by its fractal dimension. The technique suggests a new way to look at how the police system is functioning and raises questions about the situational factors. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Existing crime data sources have biases that do not present a complete picture of gun-related crime. GDT may offer a new metric for firearm crimes. However, few studies have assessed the accuracy of GDT and its relationship to other measures of violence. Methods: GDT and gun crime-related Calls for Service in Washington, DC during 2010 were studied. Using temporal comparisons for month, day of year, weekday, and hour of the day, spatial comparisons on a quarter-mile square grid, and a Poisson-Lognormal-CAR spatial regression model on a combined grid by time period dataset, we examined the sensitivity of GDT activations relative to gunshot-related calls for service. Results: The results showed that relative GDT sensitivity changed by time and by space. In particular, the relative sensitivity of GDT was much stronger in the evening and at nighttime than in the daytime. In terms of spatial variation, we found that GDT sensitivity decreased with distance from the nearest zone centroid. In addition, there were two small geographic areas in the study area in which the relative GDT sensitivity was lower than expected. Conclusions: GDT systems identify the frequency and locational accuracy of gunshot incidents, particularly at nighttime. This technology has the potential to improve data collection on gun use and violence and produce more accurate representations if the temporal and distance limitations of the technology are understood. GDT may improve gun detection and, thereby, improve police operations and public support for police. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper will focus primarily on the quantitative analysis of police calls for service data for the years 2001 and 2003.  The approximately quarter of a million calls for service logged by the Winnipeg Police Service each year are analyzed to discern temporal patterns and fluctuations.  Individual call types are analyzed against the dates of check disbursement for all types of government transfer payments, including social assistance and old age pensions.  Seasonal, weekly and spatial variations in calls for service are also examined.  The results of the quantitative analysis are supplemented by qualitative interview data gathered from a sample of social assistance recipients and front line social assistance workers.  Both the qualitative and quantitative data suggest that patterns of crime and victimization are shaped by the timing and method of government transfer payments.

The spatial analysis of neighborhood availability of alcohol outlets is key for better understanding of these influences. Most studies on the spatial distribution of alcohol outlets in the community have been conducted in U.S. cities, but few studies have assessed this spatial distribution in other countries where the drinking culture may differ. The aim of this study was to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution of alcohol outlets in the city of Valencia, Spain, and its relationship with neighborhood-level characteristics, as well as to examine the influence of alcohol outlet density on alcohol-related police calls-for-service. Spain is characterized by having a ""wet"" drinking culture and greater social acceptance of drinking compared to the U.S. Data on alcohol outlets between 2010-2015 in three categories (off-premise, restaurants and cafes, and bars) were used for the analysis. We used the 552 census block groups allocated within the city as neighborhood unit. Data were analyzed using Bayesian spatiotemporal regression models. Results showed different associations between alcohol outlets categories and neighborhood variables: off-premise density was higher in areas with lower economic status, higher immigrant concentration, and lower residential instability; restaurant and cafe density was higher in areas with higher spatially-lagged economic status, and bar density was higher in areas with higher economic status and higher spatially-lagged economic status. Furthermore, restaurant and cafe density was negatively associated with alcohol-related police calls-for-service, while bar density was positively associated with alcohol-related calls-for-service. These results can be used to inform preventive strategies for alcohol-related problems at the neighborhood-level in Spain or other countries with a wet drinking culture.

Using nine years of monthly data (2006-2014), we estimate two sets of block-level, longitudinal models to tease apart these relationships. In our first set of models, we use police actions and calls for service in the preceding month(s) to predict crime in the subsequent month. In our second set of models, we use calls for service and crime in the preceding month(s) to predict police actions in the subsequent month. We find that while changes in calls for service and crime often precede changes in police action, changes in crime also tend to follow them. For example, police stops appear to be particularly receptive to burglary: blocks with more burglaries receive greater numbers of police stops, and blocks with more police stops have reduced odds of experiencing burglary. We also find that the length of effects of predictors varies as a function of predictor and outcome: whereas some predictors exhibit short temporal effects (e.g. one month), other predictors exhibit much longer temporal effects (e.g. twelve months). Our results thus provide important insight into the spatial and temporal relationships between police actions and police incidents. Police actions must be neatly tailored to police incidents at precise levels if long-term deterrent effects at these levels are to be achieved.

Methods: A total of 1,341,608 emergency calls (28,197 calls related to mental health) to San Francisco's 911 system were made from January 2001 through June 2003. Police sector data in the call records were overlaid onto U. S. census tracts to estimate sector demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate the association between the percentage of black, Asian, Latino, and white residents and rates of mental health-related calls. Results: A one-point increase in a sector's percentage of black residents was associated with a lower rate of mental health-related calls (incidence rate ratio=.99, p<.05). A sector's percentage of Asian and Latino residents had no significant effect. Conclusions: The observed relationship between the percentage age of black residents and mental health-related calls is not consistent with known emergency mental health service utilization patterns.

The current study addresses the following question: 'Is police response to calls for service influenced by the level of serious violent crime or the level of officer staffing?' This question was addressed using crime, incident, and staffing data supplied by the Philadelphia Police Department. The dependent variable was the number of unfounded events per month, per police district, from 2004 to 2008. Analysis controlled for linear and non-linear trends, average monthly temperature, month length, and spatial effects. Data were analyzed using repeated measures multilevel modeling. Findings suggested that the quantity of unfounded events was associated with both workload and officer staffing levels. Consistent with theoretical predictions, higher workload was associated with more unfounded incidents while higher levels of officer staffing was associated with fewer unfounded incidents, net of ongoing trends and spatial effects. These findings are consistent with the Ecological Theory of Policing and suggest that officers may shed workload in response to higher demands for service or lower levels of officer availability.

Modeling and prediction of drug and opioid hotspots, where a high percentage of events fall in a small percentage of space-time, could help better focus limited social and health services. In this work we present a spatial-temporal point process model for drug overdose clustering. The data input into the model comes from two heterogeneous sources: (1) high volume emergency medical calls for service (EMS) records containing location and time but no information on the type of nonfatal overdose, and (2) fatal overdose toxicology reports from the coroner containing location and high-dimensional information from the toxicology screen on the drugs present at the time of death. We first use nonnegative matrix factorization to cluster toxicology reports into drug overdose categories, and we then develop an EM algorithm for integrating the two heterogeneous data sets, where the mark corresponding to overdose category is inferred for the EMS data and the high volume EMS data is used to more accurately predict drug overdose death hotspots. We apply the algorithm to drug overdose data from Indianapolis, showing that the point process defined on the integrated data out-performs point processes that use only coroner data (AUC improvement 0.81 to 0.85). We also investigate the extent to which overdoses are contagious, as a function of the type of overdose, while controlling for exogenous fluctuations in the background rate that might also contribute to clustering. We find that drug and opioid overdose deaths exhibit significant excitation with branching ratio ranging from 0.72 to 0.98.

Studies investigating the role of ecological factors have largely been informed by social disorganization theory. This represents considerable progress, but the community context also includes many ecological factors yet to be considered by studies examining family violence, and as such, successful neighborhood interventions have been limited. Furthermore, few community-level studies have explored whether serious family violence is geographically clustered. The current study used police calls for service data to examine how the health context of a community is associated with family violence. Accounting for spatial dependence, a higher prevalence of self-reported mental illness in a neighborhood related to family violence, although a higher prevalence of physical health difficulties was negatively associated with family violence. These results carry implications that can inform community-based efforts, particularly in economically disadvantaged neighborhood, aimed at reducing family violence.

Counter-arguments suggest crime and disorder are empirically indistinct, with disorder a less serious form of the same type of phenomenon.  The likelihood of either becoming part of the public record is linked to structural disadvantage, as well as public perception. Our study focuses on incidents of 'disorder', as recorded by a municipal bylaw agency and police service in a relatively large North American city. We consider two questions: first, how does structural disadvantage relate to recorded disorder and crime? We address this question by mapping bylaw complaints and police calls for service against the demographic and social characteristics of the city using census data. Second, how do citizens perceive the conditions in their neighbourhoods as evidenced by the types of complaints and calls received? We compare citizens' reports of various forms of disorder and those generated by the policing and bylaw agencies. Our study provides conceptual clarity to the concept of disorder and contributes to understanding both structural and individual factors that play into how this concept is understood. We speculate on the significance of this understanding for the theoretical links between disorder and crime. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]","Van Brunschot, Erin, McQuillan, Kevin",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,58

Two hypotheses are assessed: First, CFS rates will vary inversely with neighborhood disadvantage, net of the effect of objective levels of crime and other control variables; second, CFS originating in affluent neighborhoods will exhibit greater year-to-year decreases relative to disadvantaged neighborhoods following reduction of local reporting services in 2004. Findings from spatial analyses indicate that residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods tend to rely on police for assistance as much as, if not more than, people elsewhere.

Contrary to relevant theoretical predictions, extant research has failed to uncover clear neighborhood differences in victim notification of police.  However, because most of these studies are based on victimization data, they tend to be limited to a small subset of criminal offenses, hindering examination of more general differences in reliance on the police, including for those matters involving a greater degree of discretion among neighborhood residents.  Using data aggregated to the block-group level on calls for police service in a mid-size city in the Pacific Northwest, we assess the relationship between neighborhood disadvantage and reliance on police for assistance in dealing with both serious and minor crimes, as well as social disorder.

Although much of the writing both popular and scholarly on this subject has tended to focus on the financial impacts and lists of most popular types of vehicle stolen, research has not concentrated (until recently) on the ecological and spatial explanations for vehicle theft (Clarke et al., 2003; Rice et al., 2002; Rengert, 1997; Barclay et al., 1996; Poyner, 1991).

Is this relationship the result of neighborhood concentrated disadvantage, or does disability act independently of other ecological characteristics associated with high crime rates? The authors combine Census and other neighborhoodlevel data from Washington, DC to test a one-level random intercept hierarchical multiple regression model using Census tracts as a grouping variable. Disability concentration is measured by the percent of disabled residents living in a block group. Concentrated disadvantage is a composite measure including percent households below poverty line, percent families on public assistance, percent African American, percent female-headed households with children, and percent unemployed. Assault with a deadly weapon is a rate per 1,000 of police calls for assault in 2005-2006. The effect of disability concentration is partially mediated by other ecological factors, but remains a significant predictor of neighborhood rates of reported assault. Each one-unit increase in percent disabled increased police calls for assault by 0.14 %. The results of the analyses suggest that although concentrated disadvantage does affect the relationship between disability concentration and crime, it exerts an independent effect on neighborhood rates of assault with a deadly weapon.

How cooperation varies as a function of instances of police activity remains an open question. The great situational diversity of police activity in the field, matching the situational diversity of crime and disorder, makes it challenging to estimate causal effects. Here we use homicides as an indicator for the occurrence of a standardized set of highly visible, socially intensive, acute police investigative activities and examine whether police calls-for-service change in response. We adopt a place-based difference-in-differences approach that controls for local fixed affects and common temporal trends. Estimates of the model using data from Los Angeles in 2019 shows that calls-for-service increase significantly in the week following a homicide. The effect pertains to both violent crime and quality of life calls for service. Partitioning the data by race-ethnicity shows that calls-for-service increase most when the homicide victim is Black. Partitioning the data by race-ethnicity and type of homicide shows that some types of calls are suppressed when the homicide is gang-related. The results point to opportunities for police to build trust in the immediate aftermath of homicides, when the public is reaching out for greater assistance.

Common explanations include over-policing and negative interactions with police, but police reports of crime are heavily dependent on resident 911 calls. Using Sampson's concept of legal cynicism and Vaisey's dual-process theory, we theorize that racial concentration and isolation consciously and nonconsciously influence neighborhood variation in 911 calls for protection and prevention. The data we analyze are consistent with this thesis. Independent of police reports of crime, we find that neighborhood racial segregation in 1990 and the legal cynicism about crime prevention and protection it engenders have lasting effects on 911 calls more than a decade later, in 2006-2008. Our theory explains this persistent predictive influence through continuity and change in intervening factors. A source of cumulative continuity, the intensification of neighborhood racial concentration and isolation between 1990 and 2000, predicts 911 calls. Likewise, sources of change-heightened neighborhood incarceration and home foreclosures during the financial crisis in 2006-2008-also predict these calls. Our findings are consistent with legal cynicism theory's focus on neighborhood disadvantage, racial isolation, and concerns about police protection and crime prevention; they correspond less with the emphasis of procedural justice theory on police legitimacy.

This study devised a Negative Community-Police Relationship Index Score that operationalized the expected risk of a negative community-police relationship for each of the sections. In April 2015, a Baltimore resident, Freddie Gray, died while in BPD custody. A Poisson regression model assessed whether this high-profile death-in-police-custody incident adversely affected the volume of non-criminal caretaking calls to the police and whether that effect was strongest in sections at a high risk of a negative community-police relationship. A falsification test used pocket-dialed emergency calls to verify that any observed trends were not the result of overall telephone usage. Results There was no statistical evidence that the death-in-police-custody incident produced any changes in community reliance on the police for non-criminal caretaking matters, even in high-risk sections. A supplemental analysis using calls for criminal matters yielded similar results. As the falsification test demonstrated, the observed trends were not the result of overall telephone usage. Conclusions Despite a divisive death-in-police-custody incident, citizens were still willing to enlist police assistance. More broadly, the caretaking role of the police may be an important mechanism to strengthen community-police relations, particularly in marginalized neighborhoods vulnerable to strained community-police relations.

Controlling for crime, prior call patterns, and several neighborhood characteristics, we find that residents of Milwaukee's neighborhoods, especially residents of black neighborhoods, were far less likely to report crime after Jude's beating was broadcast. The effect lasted for over a year and resulted in a total net loss of approximately 22,200 calls for service. Other local and national cases of police violence against unarmed black men also had a significant impact on citizen crime reporting in Milwaukee.

He proposed an inverse relationship between the levels of crime and disorder in the officerâs working environment and the amount of formal legal authority used by an officer. That is, the greater the level of crime and disorder in the patrol district, the lower the amount of formal legal authority expended by the officer. Past studies framed within the ecological theory found limited support for Klingerâs notion. It is suggested that prior studies inaccurately operationalised the âpatrol districtâ variable because the study areas were too large to adequately assess his theory. This study expands on past research framed within the ecological theory by operationalising the police patrol area based on US Census âblock groupsâ. Results indicate that the rate of arrests in a block group was related to higher levels of calls for service, which is contrary to what is expected with the ecological theory.

1229,JOUR,Can routinely collected ambulance data about assaults contribute to reduction in community violence?,2015,"CRIME, EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT, PREVENTING VIOLENCE",EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL,32,4,308,313,NA,NA,"Background The 'law of spatiotemporal concentrations of events' introduced major preventative shifts in policing communities. 'Hotspots' are at the forefront of these developments yet somewhat understudied in emergency medicine. Furthermore, little is known about interagency 'data-crossover', despite some developments through the Cardiff Model. Can police-ED interagency data-sharing be used to reduce community-violence using a hotspots methodology? Methods 12-month (2012) descriptive study and analysis of spatiotemporal clusters of police and emergency calls for service using hotspots methodology and assessing the degree of incident overlap. 3775 violent crime incidents and 775 assault incidents analysed using spatiotemporal clustering with k-means++ algorithm and Spearman's rho. Results Spatiotemporal location of calls for services to the police and the ambulance service are equally highly concentrated in a small number of geographical areas, primarily within intra-agency hotspots (33% and 53%, respectively) but across agencies' hotspots as well (25% and 15%, respectively). Datasets are statistically correlated with one another at the 0.57 and 0.34 levels, with 50% overlap when adjusted for the number of hotspots. At least one in every two police hotspots does not have an ambulance hotspot overlapping with it, suggesting half of assault spatiotemporal concentrations are unknown to the police. Data further suggest that more severely injured patients, as estimated by transfer to hospital, tend to be injured in the places with the highest number of police-recorded crimes. Conclusions A hotspots approach to sharing data circumvents the problem of disclosing person-identifiable data between different agencies. Practically, at least half of ambulance hotspots are unknown to the police; if causal, it suggests that data sharing leads to both reduced community violence by way of prevention (such as through anticipatory patrols or problem-oriented policing), particularly of more severe assaults, and improved efficiency of resource deployment.

In addition to addressing questions such as who is stopped and why vehicles are stopped, this article focuses on the geographic variations and racial variations of the stops in the fifty-two neighborhood areas of the City of Cincinnati. Racial disparities in vehicle stops are often linked to the controversial issue of racial profiling. A new measure, disproportionality, is developed to better capture such disparities. Many earlier studies used census population as the baseline in calculating disproportionality indices, based on an implicit assumption that people only drive in the neighborhood where they live. A reasonable baseline should reflect how many people drive in a neighborhood and how many miles are driven in a neighborhood. This study replaces census population by vehicle miles as the baseline. An innovative approach is developed to estimate vehicle miles in each neighborhood. The research concludes that small disparities exist between Black and White drivers in Cincinnati while the magnitude varies significantly by neighborhood areas, and that the spatial pattern of stops appears to be associated with those of driving patterns, crime, drug calls, overall demand for police services, and traffic accidents. Specifically, the correlations between sropping rates for African-Americans and accident rates and minor crimes are particularly high.","Liu, L, Eck, J",English,"Department of Geography, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221-0131, United States School of Geography and Planning, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China Division of Criminal Justice, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45221-0389",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,77

Further, agencies often use traffic enforcement to achieve both traffic safety and crime control. Given these goals, the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether (and to what extent) officers are accurately targeting their proactive traffic enforcement with crime and vehicle crashes in two agencies. Design/methodology/approach The study examines traffic enforcement patterns in two agencies to see whether proactive traffic enforcement aligns spatially with crime and vehicle crashes. This study employs negative binomial regression models with clustered standard errors to investigate this alignment at the micro-spatial level. Key variables of interest are measured with police calls for service data, traffic citation data and vehicle crash data from two law enforcement jurisdictions. Findings High levels of spatial association are observed between traffic accidents and crime in both agencies, lending empirical support to the underlying theories of traffic enforcement programs that also try to reduce crime (i.e. ""DDACTS""). In both agencies, traffic accidents also appear to be the most prominent predictor of police proactive traffic enforcement activities, even across different times of day. However, when vehicle crashes are accounted for, the association between crime and traffic stops is weaker, even during times of day when agencies believe they are using proactive traffic enforcement as a crime deterrent. Originality/value No prior study to authors knowledge has examined the empirical association between police proactive traffic activities and crime and traffic accidents in practice. The current study seeks to fill that void by investigating the realities of traffic stops as practiced daily by police officers, and their alignment with crime and vehicle crashes. Such empirical inquiry is especially important given the prevalent use of traffic enforcement as a common proactive policing tool by police agencies to control both traffic and crime problems.

Due to this fact, valuable time is often wasted by connecting or transferring emergency calls from one dispatching center to another. The purpose of this study was to analyse all calls received by the different dispatching centers in the city and county area of Mainz with respect to total number, fraction of emergency calls, and specificity. Further, the total number of calls potentially referring to a hypothetic single dispatching center with a general emergency phone number (112) was calculated. During a 4-month period, all telephone calls were registered and related to day, time, and origin of the call (city or county) and classified as non-urgent or emergency calls, calls appropriate to the dispatching center dialed, emergency calls to be transferred, or unspecific calls. A total of 80987 calls were received (city area 84.3%, county area 15.7%), most of them directed to the FB of Mainz (33086), The EMS dispatching center received 31286 calls, the five GPS-centers 15 256 calls; 1359 emergency calls that were directed to the police or FB needed transfer to the EMS. During weekdays the EMS and FB received the most calls, with a reduced frequency on Saturdays and Sundays (Table 2). Nevertheless, the highest total numbers of calls were received on Saturdays due to multiple calls directed to the GPS. The FB had the highest specificity of calls; more than 50% of the calls to the GPS were unspecific (Fig. 1). Of all calls, 4.37% were classified as emergency calls; two-thirds of these came from the area of Mainz during the daytime. During off-duty hours of the GPS in the city, 51% of the emergency calls reached the EMS directly; 49% had to be connected by the police or FB. During duty hours of the GPS, the fraction of calls directed to the EMS decreased significantly to 35%. During duty hours of the GPS centers in the county area, only 14% of the urgent emergency calls reached the EMS dispatcher directly (Fig. 2). Compared to the multiple-center mode, a hypothetic single dispatching center for all systems would probably be followed by a slight increase in total number of calls due to the fact that the GPS numbers would be answered 24 h a day, but there would be only minimal differences in the total number received on most days; only on Sundays would a decrease be expected. The EMS area of Mainz, with a total of 13 different telephone numbers for 7 dispatching centers, can be regarded as typical of the German situation. The high number of emergency calls to be transferred (up to 86% under special circumstances) demonstrated that this weak point in the German EMS system must be eliminated by introducing a single emergency number. This should occur when a Europe-wide three-digit number ''112'' will be instituted, probably in 1995. Additionally, the continued existence of 5- or 10-digit telephone numbers for non-urgent calls may be useful for allowing non-verbal differentiation of calls. In any case, all telephone numbers, including the latter calls, have to enter one dispatching center. The main advantage of a single dispatching center would be avoidance of the time-consuming transfer of emergency calls from one dispatching center to the other.

California has suffered severe drought since 2011, resulting in intensely dry winters and several of the hottest days on record. It is likely that the drought increased economic stress and shifted routine activities of the population, potentially increasing the likelihood of crime. We used a synthetic control method to estimate the impact of California's drought on both property and violent crimes. We found a significant increase in property crimes during the drought, but no effect on violent crimes. This result was robust to several sensitivity analyses, including a negative control.

Our study is aimed at better understanding this link. Methods: Focusing on a high-crime neighborhood in Ohio, we use spatial video and calls for service (CFS) to examine how crime changed on streets where abandoned homes were removed. We also draw on the insights of 35 ex-offenders, police officers, and residents to examine how and why abandoned houses are connected to crime in this locale. Results: On average, streets where abandoned houses were razed accounted for a lower proportion of neighborhood crime after removal. Also, a lower proportion of total CFS from these streets related to serious crime. Our narrative data indicate that abandoned houses are opportunistic because they provide cover, unoccupied spaces, and are easy targets. Conclusions: The removal of abandoned housing was associated with positive changes in crime overall; however, our approach revealed interesting variation across streets. We surmise that the relevance of a particular abandoned house may be contingent on the larger context of that street or neighborhood. In order to understand these dynamics, future research should continue to ""drill down"" into micro-spaces.

The VLI uses data on crime, deprivation and socio-demography to form a single composite index value for small geographic areas, which when mapped can assist in determining where to target neighbourhood policing and crime prevention initiatives. Its use has also helped to prompt other public sector partners such as local municipal government agencies to recognise the collaborative role that they could play with the police in helping to address mutual issues of public safety. Fire safety agencies have also expressed interest in the VLI, but to date this has mainly involved offering a supporting role to the police and local community safety partnerships on crime specific matters of public safety, with a focus on fire safety often on the periphery. In part this is due to limited analysis into whether the priority areas identified by the VLI are also areas of key concern to fire services. This research explores this relationship, identifying that the priority neighbourhoods of interest to the police are also areas where there are significantly higher than expected levels of deliberate fires and malicious false alarm calls to the fire service. These findings suggest that in the spirit of partnership working, potential opportunities exist in achieving mutually beneficial gains in improving public safety through the collaboration of fire, police and other local public service delivery.

Ill effects of community disadvantage are especially pronounced in neighborhoods where disadvantage is multifaceted and distributed widely among residentsÃ¢ÂÂfeatures that often characterize large public housing communities providing subsidized housing for low-income households.  Partly in an effort to ameliorate the effects of concentrated disadvantage, large-scale initiatives beginning in the 1990s relocated households out of older, high-density public housing communities.  We assess the effects in one city of a nearly 50% reduction in available public housing units on community measures of violence derived from police reports, 911 calls, and hospital emergency department records.  Multivariate estimation methods for panel data are applied to spatial/time-series data to estimate the effects of reductions in public housing residents on neighborhood violence levels, focusing especially on impacts in communities that border high density public housing and other likely destination communities.

We asked two questions: (a) Is criminal activity in San Diego particularly acute at peep show establishments compared to surrounding control locations? and (b) Is criminal activity in San Diego disproportionately greater at or near peep show establishments between the hours of 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. compared to other times of the day? The levels of crime activity and the expenditure of police resources were examined by measuring the number of calls-for-service (CFSs) to the police within a 1,000-ft. area on either side of the peep show establishments and comparably-sized control areas beyond the immediate 1,000-foot area. A more focused ""late-night"" (2 a.m. to 6 a.m.) analysis was also undertaken. The results showed no reliable evidence of differences in crime levels between the control and test areas, nor was there any evidence of disproportionately greater amounts of crime within the 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. time period in the areas surrounding the peep show establishments. We concluded that San Diego does not have a problem with crime at the peep show establishments generally, nor is there a heightened problem with crime during the 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. period.

Marginalised and often minority communities often complain about over and under policing, that is, policing that harasses local residents but does not address serious crime. In recent years, concerns with the institutional legitimacy of the police in the US and elsewhere have risen in public discussions and in scientific research. Current models of police legitimacy tend to focus on transactions between the police and the public over matters of procedural justice; however, taking a more contextual view of police interventions in communities provides opportunities to look beyond transactions and sort out the socio-cultural acceptance of the police against the myriad of services they provide to communities. Here we focus on census tracts in Boston, merging calls for service data with perceptual survey data. We find significant differences in the types of police services requested by advantaged and disadvantaged communities. Public-initiated calls for service are largely for emergency response matters as opposed to crime prevention and community restoration; police-initiated services, however, are more evenly distributed across prevention, response, and restoration. While residents of disadvantaged, high-crime communities request the police more often, they perceive themselves as unwilling to report crime. Additionally, they perceive their communities as unsafe while also viewing the police as less legitimate. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]","St. Louis, Stacie, Greene, Jack R",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,90

One describes the police as a racist, enforcement arm of the economic and political elite. The second line of thinking asserts that minorities are disproportionately involved in criminal activity and, consequently, holds disproportionate minority contact by the police to be the natural consequences of disproportionate criminality. This article explores a third possibility, namely, that policing is a social service and some people consume that service, along with other social services, at higher rates. The rates of calls for service to the police significantly affect deployment of police resources. If some neighborhoods call the police significantly more than others, those neighborhoods are likely to have police deployed to them significantly more than others. This assumption was borne out by the data. Comparing service utilization rates in the City of Houston across census tracts and service categories, this article reveals that areas of the community that disproportionately consume other social services also disproportionately call the police. Specifically, this study reveals patterns of fire and EMS service utilization by minorities that are comparable to their rates of police service utilization. The study also reveals that the pattern of police service over- utilization is similar to the pattern of over-utilization of public assistance.

This paper takes up the issue using data on the growth of Airbnbs and calls for service to the police in Portland, Oregon, Nashville, Tennessee, and New Orleans, Louisiana. We find that Airbnbs tend to locate in areas with high calls for service and that an increase in Airbnbs in the previous month is correlated with a small increase in calls related to revelry and property crimes, and a decrease with respect to suspicious individuals.

Since many policing activities require the physical presence of officers, a crucial issue for police effectiveness concerns the extent to which officers are located where they are needed. Operationally, this can be framed as a 'supply and demand' issue, where the aim is to match the supply of police resource to the demand for service. In this paper, we examine this issue for a five-month period in London, UK, using police vehicle tracking data and call-for-service records. We examine the extent to which supply and demand are aligned at the street segment level and build a statistical model which seeks to explain the disparity between the two quantities in terms of network structure. We find that police activity is distributed unevenly, with over-supply on more central streets, and discuss the implications of this for police practice.

The article employs tests of significance to assess the overall effects of zoning on these police activities across pre- and post-intervention periods and uses both weighted displacement quotient (WDQ) and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) models to test for possible displacement associated with zoning. Results indicate that weed and seed zoning was significantly associated with displacement of arrest activity in pre- and post-intervention time periods but displayed no relationship with displacement of calls for assistance (CFAs). Though WDQ analyses do not indicate proximity effects, local indicators of spatial association (LISA) maps show noteworthy changes in the spatial clustering of arrest activity over time. Of principal concern here is the idea that weed and seed may prompt changes in the geography of crime without actually reducing crime rates. An ancillary concern is whether significantly higher arrest rates within weed and seed zones represent advances in community policing.

Despite increasing public attention, and growing demands for policy change, little is actually known about the myriad of ways in which Canadian police encounter PMI in the context of routine police work. To assist policymakers in developing evidence-informed policy, this paper attempts to shed light on present difficulties associated with addressing fundamental questions, such as the prevalence of mental health related issues in police calls for service. To do this, we attempt to map the size and scope of police calls for service involving PMI, drawing on both the available scientific data and the limited knowledge to be gleaned from available police reports. Our focus is on two broad categories of police interactions with citizens: public safety concerns (wellness checks, suicide threats, missing persons, mental health apprehensions) and crime prevention and response (encountering PMI as victims-complainants and (or) as potential suspects). We also explore the challenges policy-makers face in relying on police data and the importance of overcoming weaknesses in data collection and sharing in relation to the policing of uniquely vulnerable groups. This paper concludes with some key recommendations for addressing gaps highlighted. Â© 2021 Facets.

However, as a business that serves alcohol, some jurisdictions are concerned with potential negative externalities associated with craft breweries. One concern is a possible increase in crime. Using Portland as a case study, our purpose in this paper is to quantitatively assess changes in crime levels after the opening of a craft brewery. Using detailed data on calls for service to the Portland Police Bureau and brewery locations with their opening dates, we estimate the relationship between brewery openings and crime between 2012 and 2018. We control for brewery specific attributes, city-wide trends, and changes in neighborhood characteristics that may also affect crime levels. Our findings suggest that there is no significant change in crime around craft brewery locations post opening. However, the findings do provide guidance as to under which conditions brewery locations may be associated with relatively less or more crime. While breweries located in residential, industrial, or employment zones tend to be associated with less crime, breweries located in clusters in commercial zones tend to experience more crime.

The lack of a data-driven approach for delineating these boundaries produces non-uniform demand across beat zones, thus resulting in an uneven distribution of workload among officers. We analyzed 911-calls received in a mid-sized Texas city over a period of 4 years and found differences in service call volume serviced by each of the five current beat zones that lead to workload disparities and uneven response times. Readily available 911-service call data integrated into Geographic Information Systems can be used to create boundaries of police beat zones that aim to minimize the differences in the number of service calls originating from each beat zone. Most recently developed approach, the Universal PArtitioning System, was used to produce contiguous spatial partitions of approximately equal call volume resulting in configurations that have a more uniform distribution of calls thus reducing the disparities in officer workload between beat zones. The efficiency of using a computational, data-driven approach allows police to evaluate the impacts of several beat zone configurations on their ability to provide service with respect to available resources.

Design/methodology/approach The developed model employs a methodology for knowledge discovery involving text mining techniques and uses latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with collapsed Gibbs sampling to obtain topics related to crime. Findings The method used in this study enabled identification of the most common crimes that occurred in the period from 1 January to 31 December of 2016. An analysis of the identified topics reaffirmed that crimes do not occur in a linear manner in a given locality. In this study, 40 per cent of the crimes identified in integrated public safety area 5, or AISP 5 (the historic centre of the city of RJ), had no correlation with AISP 19 (Copacabana - RJ), and 33 per cent of the crimes in AISP 19 were not identified in AISP 5. Research limitations/implications - The collected data represent the social dynamics of neighbourhoods in the central and southern zones of the city of Rio de Janeiro during the specific period from January 2013 to December 2016. This limitation implies that the results cannot be generalised to areas with different characteristics. Practical implications - The developed methodology contributes in a complementary manner to the identification of criminal practices and their characteristics based on police occurrence reports stored in emergency response databases. The generated knowledge enables law enforcement experts to assess, reformulate and construct differentiated strategies for combating crimes in a given locality. Social implications The production of knowledge from the emergency service database contributes to the government integrating information with other databases, thus enabling the improvement of strategies to combat local crime. The proposed model contributes to research on big data, on the innovation aspect and on decision support, for it breaks with a paradigm of analysis of criminal information.

Design/methodology/approach The developed model uses a methodology for the discovery of knowledge involving text mining techniques using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) integrated with the ELECTRE I multicriteria method. Findings The developed method allowed the identification of the most common criminal demands that occurred from January 1 to December 31, 2016, in the policing areas studied. One of the crimes does not occur homogeneously in a particular locality. In this study, it was initially observed that 40 per cent of the crimes identified in the Integrated Public Safety Area 5, or AISP-5, (historical city center of RJ) had no correlation with AISP-19 (Copacabana - RJ), and 33 per cent of crimes crimes in AISP-19 were not identified in AISP-5. This finding guided the second part of the method that sought to identify which portfolio of policing strategies would be most appropriate for the identified demands. In this sense, using the ELECTRE I method, eight different scenarios were constructed where it can be identified that for each specific criminal demand set there is a set of policing strategies to be applied. Social implications It is possible to infer that by choosing appropriate strategies to combat local crime, the proposed model will increase the population's sense of safety through an effective reduction in crime.

Scholars have documented zero-tolerance policing and emerging tactics of therapeutic policing in these efforts, but little attention has been paid to 911 calls and forms of third-party policing in governing public space and the poor. Drawing on an analysis of 3.9 million 911 and 311 call records and participant observation alongside police officers, social workers, and homeless men and women residing on the streets of San Francisco, this article elaborates a model of ""complaint-oriented policing"" to explain additional causes and consequences of policing visible poverty. Situating the police within a broader bureaucratic field of poverty governance, I demonstrate how policing aimed at the poor can be initiated by callers, organizations, and government agencies, and how police officers manage these complaints in collaboration and conflict with health, welfare, and sanitation agencies. Expanding the conception of the criminalization of poverty, which is often centered on incarceration or arrest, the study reveals previously unforeseen consequences of move-along orders, citations, and threats that dispossess the poor of property, create barriers to services and jobs, and increase vulnerability to violence and crime.

We hypothesize that land use is a key factor influencing both resident-based control and physical deterioration and that these, in turn, are related to calls for service. Analyses show that the presence of storefronts is the strongest determinant of calls for service for crime and non crime problems. Physical deterioration and resident-based control are less influential. In accord with our hypotheses, land use influences resident-based control and deterioration. It appears that land use and physical deterioration influence different aspects of resident-based informal control. Also, not all dimensions of resident-based control relate to police activity. Results underscore the importance of clarifying which specific dimensions of land use, deterioration, and resident-based control influence crime-related outcomes.

First, calls for service were analyzed by changing distributions based on street size, intensity of crime and color of area. The second redesign focused on models for assessing, analyzing, and mapping hazardous space for police work (areas where officers are injured). Finally, the third analyzed police response to special events. Overall, additional research and development of mapping and GIS technology is necessary in the field. New partnerships also have to be formed between the police and those responsible for monitoring environments for these technologies to produce meaningful results.","LeBeau, J L",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,114

Using data on calls for service dispatched to LAPD patrols from 2014 through 2017, we assess if heightened awareness of immigration enforcement, as captured by a novel Google Trends index on related searches, is associated with reduced calls to report domestic violence in predominately Latino noncitizen neighborhoods. We find that domestic violence calls per capita dropped in LAPD reporting districts with a higher concentration of Latino noncitizens as awareness about immigration enforcement increased. The decline provides empirical evidence of the ""chilling effect"" of immigration enforcement on Latino immigrant engagement with police, underscoring the need to engage communities increasingly alienated by federal immigration policy.

However, the detailed geographical dimension of this relationship has been largely ignored. The aim of this paper is to broaden the research on weather and crime to consider the effect of weather parameters on the spatial arrangement of crime within an urban area of the UK. A novel combination of techniques that are capable of both evaluating statistically and visualising geographically the effect of weather variables on the incidence of one type of crime, namely calls for police service for disorder or disturbances, is presented. These techniques are examined in relation to the theories that have traditionally been put forward to explain such trends. We conclude that, in our study area, both temperature and humidity exert significant effects on the spatial patterning of incidents of disorder or disturbances. Rainfall, wind speed, and wind direction were found not to have a significant effect for this type of call for service. More research is needed to see how transferable these findings are to other geographical areas with different climatic regimes.

This hypothesis was tested by subjecting calls for service received by police in Dallas, Texas, to multivariate analyses of covariance that employed weather variables as predictors and controlled for the temporal variables of holidays, time of day, day of the week, and season of the year. As the NAE model predicts, assaults in probably climate-controlled settings were a linear function of temperature, whereas assaults in settings that probably lacked climate control declined after peaking at moderately high temperatures. The results are consistent with recent attempts to use the concept of social avoidance to integrate routine activity theory and psychological theories of aggression.

Ecological structures such as higher numbers of alcohol outlets and abandoned/vacant properties in geographically dense, poor, and socially isolated communities are critically important to consider. Further, disadvantaged urban communities are burdened by greater police presence with limited or no abatement in crime or violence. Purpose: Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, spatial analysis techniques, and a negative binomial regression analyses, this study investigated the relationships between alcohol outlet density consisting of license C (i.e., combined on and off premises establishments) and license D (i.e., off premises establishments such as liquor stores), abandoned properties, and police calls to service on aggravated assault rates in a Northeastern United States urban city. Results: Negative binomial regression analysis results showed that license C alcohol outlet density count (IRR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.08, 2.11), license D alcohol outlet density count (IRR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.30), abandoned property count (IRR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.01, 2.01), and police call to service counts (IRR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.50) were positively associated with aggravated assault rates. Analyses controlled for census data characteristics. Conclusions: The link between alcohol outlet density and violent crime has been established in public health research. However, this study represents an important contribution in recognizing the unique relationships between license C and license D alcohol outlet density, abandoned properties, and police calls to service with aggravated assaults in an urban neighborhood. Conclusions are drawn for policy and practice.

Design/methodology/approach - The spatial analytic technique, risk terrain modeling was performed on felonious battery data provided by the Chicago Police Department. Findings - Out of the 991 batteries against law enforcement officers (LEOs) in Chicago, 11 features of the physical environment were identified as presenting a statistically significant spatial risk of battery to LEOs. Calls for service within three blocks of foreclosures and/or within a dense area of problem buildings pose as much as two times greater risk of battery to police officers than what is presented by other significant spatial factors in the model. Originality/value - An abundance of existing research on aggression toward law enforcement is situated from the perspective of characteristics of the suspect or officer. The research advances the field of violence studies by illustrating the importance of incorporating physical features of the environment into empirical studies of aggression.

To design and operate these systems efficiently much data needs to be collected and properly utilised. Here, we use the OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to model the demand points (DPs), which approximate the geographical location of customers, and the road network, which is used to access or distribute services. We consider all inhabitants as customers, and therefore to estimate the demand, we use the available population grids. People are changing their location in the course of the day and thus the demand for services is changing accordingly. In this paper, we investigate how the used demand estimate affects the optimal design of a public service system. We calculate and compare efficient designs corresponding to two demand models, a night-time demand model when the majority of inhabitants rest at home and the demand model derived from the 24-hour average of the population density. We propose a simple measure to quantify the differences between population grids and we estimate how the size of differences affects the optimal structure of a public service system. Our analyses reveal that the efficiency of the service system is not only dependent on the placement strategy, but an inappropriate demand model has significant effects when designing a system as well as when evaluating its efficiency.
